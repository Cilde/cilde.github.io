<h1>Hardware Software</h1>
<h2>HARDWARE and SOFTWARE are two seperate things, they are key to the usage of a device, hardware is what makes the device run, and software is a layer which the hardware is translated too. Hardware and software communicate through the Kernel, the Kernel runs all programs, however, everyday programs you use like Photoshop and Microsoft Edge are done in the User Space, drivers which directly communicate the hardware and software are done in the kernel, these are two seperate things as in order to communicate in the kernal itself you need to write drivers, which are dangerous, in the programming languages C. Now to get to the actual thing, devices are using software to create other software, one piece of software can make another piece of software and this is key to making stuff work on it.</h2>
